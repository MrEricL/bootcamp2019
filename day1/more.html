                    Andrew Carnegie's giving to create thousands of public libraries around the United States is one of the more well-known stories of how philanthropy has improved life in America. Most of those libraries are still around today, and even in the age of the internet, libraries remain very popular institutions that play a variety of vital roles in U.S. life. Seniors, parents with young children, students, veterans, the unemployed and immigrants all make big use of America's 9,000 or so public libraries.

                    Which often leads us to wonder: Why don't we see more gifts to libraries? Sure, we've seen some such gifts, but not many as you might think at a moment when so many new donors are showing up in philanthropy looking for places where their money might make an impact. Libraries could certainly use a boost. In many cities and towns, public libraries are hurting because of budgetary cutbacksâ€”and more cuts may be on the way with the Trump administration targeting federal library funding.
