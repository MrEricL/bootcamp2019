      <h3>Save New York Public Library</h3>
        <q>There are many businessmen who own knowledge today. Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose 37% profit margin stands in sharp contrast to the rising fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages for adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest databases of academic material, which are licensed at prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest university of the global north, has complained that it cannot afford them any longer. Robert Darnton, the past director of Harvard Library, says <em><q>We faculty do the research, write the papers, referee papers by other researchers, serve on editorial boards, all of it for free â€¦ and then we buy back the results of our labour at outrageous prices.</q></em> For all the work supported by public money benefiting scholarly publishers, particularly the peer review that grounds their legitimacy, journal articles are priced such that they prohibit access to science to many academics - and all non-academics - across the world, and render it a token of privilege.</q>
        <br /><br />
        <q><strong>Care for the libraries - care for the metadata - care for the backup.</strong></q><br />
